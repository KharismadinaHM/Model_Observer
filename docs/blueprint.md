# **App Name**: Model Observer

## Core Features:

- Dashboard: Dashboard to visualize key model metrics (performance, latency, errors).
- Data Upload: Ability to upload or input model performance data (e.g., from a CSV file or API endpoint).
- Chart Configuration: Configurable charts to display model metrics over time, with options to select different metrics and time ranges.
- Anomaly Detection: Use an AI tool to automatically detect anomalies in model performance based on historical data and alert users.
- Alerting System: Alerting system to notify users of performance issues or anomalies via on-screen notifications.
- Data Drift Detection: Detect and alert on data drift issues using AI algorithms.
- Logging Inference: Log model inference requests and responses for auditing and debugging.
- Model Metrics Logging: Log and track key model metrics (accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score).
- Performance Dashboard: Comprehensive performance dashboard for visualizing model health and performance.
- Model Registry Integration: Integrate with a Model Registry to track model versions and deployments.
- Monitoring Latency & Error Rate: Monitor model latency and error rate in real-time.
- Canary / Shadow Deployment Support: Support canary and shadow deployments for safe model rollouts.
- Feedback Loop: Implement a feedback loop to continuously improve model performance based on user feedback (using AI).

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Dark blue (#2c3e50) for a professional look.
- Secondary color: Light gray (#ecf0f1) for backgrounds and accents.
- Accent: Teal (#1abc9c) for interactive elements and highlights.
- Clean and readable sans-serif fonts for data clarity.
- Use simple, geometric icons to represent different metrics and functions.
- Clean and well spaced out dashboard layout.
- Subtle transitions and animations for a smooth user experience.
